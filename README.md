#TODO 
1) Implement Port Detection so The script finds your ESP for you.
2) Implement max speed checking so that it tests the ability to program 
at higher speeds before falling back to a slower one.
3) Implement Flash size tester so that you can easily verify that the 
module you ordered is the correct size.
